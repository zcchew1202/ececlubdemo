ECE Club Webteam Demo Repo
==========================

Introduction
------------

### What's This Doc?
This is a repository to get your web-world adventure started.  Everyone in the club (including the Tom, Wenxin, and I) will use this repo as a collection of learning materials; what you did, what you tried, etc.  The ideology is that there is no stupid code, and keeping everything you've done in a neat place can helps you a lot later on in your career as a software developer.

The objective goal of this repo is to help you keep yourself organized, and to keep everyone else organized too, you'll see why this is the case later.

### Motivation!
The structure of this repo will be very similar to a portfolio.  You will make a folder with your name or initials, and all the cool things you decide to try out should be placed in that folder.  Periodically you will commit and push your commits, that way you can keep track on your progress, and allow others to learn from your code.  Or even better, if you are confused on something, write it in the commit message.  That way when you look back, you can very easily find a change set where you had a question, and find people to help you solve it.  This way everyone will know how each other is doing, and help each other out when we are in need.

### Further Down the Road~
When we get to a state where there is a significant amount of collaboration going on, I will personally accept merge requests and bring everyone's repos together to form a comfortable basis for everything to start making the ece club projects in.  The hope is by that time, everyone would be comfortable with our repo's structure, languages, frameworks, and know how to work together as a team.  



Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites
- It is expected that by now, after attending the git tutorial session, that you are familiar with working from the command-line. 
- It is also assumed that you know how to use git. Or at least know to fork, clone, pull, commit, and push repos.
- I hope you have a github account.
- Last but certainly not least, I hope you are genuinely interested in coding.

### First Steps
1. Clone this repo on github and Facebook Tom, Wenxin, or me your github username so we can add you to the list of users who are allowed to contribute to this repository.
2. Make a folder with your name or initial on it.  You will see that there is already a repo there called ```dgli```.  That's my repository where I will be putting my stuff.  
    **It is very important that you only ever modify the files in the folders that belong to you.  This repo works on a trust basis.  Other people will be pushing code to this repo too in their folders.** Of course you can look and learn from their code, but please don't touch other's code unless you have their permission to do so.
3. After you made your folder, put something in it (like a readme file or something) and commit then push it.  If this is the first few times you've used git, you will no doubt have a bunch of stupid looking errors thrown to you by git.  But don't worry, I assure that they are your fault and the solutions can always be found if you just take 3 seconds to search it up on google.  It's all a part of the learning process!

### Choosing your poison
After you are in your own folder you are free to do whatever you wish, but here's a few guidelines that would help you along: If you wish, follow the following links (if you are interested in the topic) and try things out.  Don't forget to do it in your folder, keep things neat, and commit regularly.

#### Frontend
For frontend, the main tech we will be using is Bootstrap.  Here are a few nice links:
- This is the default bootstrap tutorial http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/
- Excellent explanation to literally everything:  http://www.w3schools.com/
- Get well organized API documentations: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

A good way to start learning is to find a site you like, and try to remake the exact same thing.  Try to replicate what they do to the best of your abilities.  Because after all, great programmers copy  ;)

#### Backend
For backend, we will be using NodeJS and Sails.JS.  For this, just google "How to install NodeJS" and follow a guide to set yourself up.  Then head to http://sailsjs.org/ to get started.  You **should** become familiar with NPM (Node Package Manager), Grunt, and similar developer tools.  This is a hard road to tread down because there really isn't any concrete tutorial or book on how to do these things.  It's all about exploring and googling, and hopefully sleeping.


**This readme will be periodically updated with more resources.  Stay tuned.**
